üìå Most Common and Useful grep Commands

Usage	                             Command	                              Explanation
Simple search	                     grep "hello" file.txt	                Search for "hello" inside file.txt.
Case-insensitive search	           grep -i "hello" file.txt	              Ignore case (matches "hello", "HELLO", "HeLLo").
Recursive search	                 grep -r "hello" /path/to/directory	    Search through all files in a directory and its subdirectories.
Show line numbers	                 grep -n "hello" file.txt	              Show matching line numbers.
Search exact word match	           grep -w "hello" file.txt	              Only match the whole word "hello" (not "hello123").
Count matches	                     grep -c "hello" file.txt	              Count how many lines match.
Invert match	                     grep -v "hello" file.txt	              Show all lines that do not contain "hello".
Display filenames only	           grep -l "hello" *.txt	                Show only filenames with at least one match.
Search multiple patterns	         `grep -E "hello	                      world" file.txt`
Highlight matches	                 grep --color=auto "hello" file.txt	    Highlight the match in color (usually default behavior on many distros).


üéØ Frequently Combined with Other Commands

Usage	                               Command	                              Explanation
Search inside ps output	             `ps aux | grep nginx`
Find errors in logs	                 grep -i "error" /var/log/syslog	      Search for "error" messages in system logs.
Combine with dmesg	                `dmesg grep usb`
Find open ports	                    `netstat -tulnp | grep 80`


üõ†Ô∏è Pro Tip: Use grep with find
If you want to search text across a large number of files:

find /path -name "*.log" | xargs grep "fatal"

Or better (handling spaces in filenames):

find /path -name "*.log" -print0 | xargs -0 grep "fatal"


üöÄ Advanced Useful Flags

Flag	          Description
-A NUM	        Show NUM lines After the match.
-B NUM	        Show NUM lines Before the match.
-C NUM	        Show NUM lines Around the match (Context).
-P	            Interpret the pattern as Perl-compatible regex (PCRE).
-F	            Interpret pattern as a fixed string, not a regex (faster).

Example:

grep -C 3 "error" /var/log/syslog
Shows 3 lines before and after every match of "error."

üß† Short Summary
grep is your go-to tool to find text fast.
It is simple yet very powerful when combined with pipelines (|), find, awk, sed, etc.
It's one of the "must-master" commands for Linux work, scripting, troubleshooting, and log analysis.
